# Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design Torrents
 
If you want to learn the basics of object-oriented programming, one of the best ways is to download and watch the video course *Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design* by Simon Allardice. This course covers the essential concepts and principles of object-oriented design, such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. You will also learn how to apply these concepts to design and implement software solutions using various programming languages and frameworks.

However, this course is not free and you may not have access to it through your school or workplace. That's why some people resort to using torrents to download the course illegally. Torrents are peer-to-peer file sharing systems that allow users to download files from other users who have them. While this may seem convenient and cost-effective, it also comes with many risks and disadvantages.
 
First of all, using torrents to download copyrighted content is illegal and unethical. You are violating the intellectual property rights of the creator and the distributor of the course. You are also depriving them of the revenue they deserve for their hard work and expertise. By downloading torrents, you are contributing to piracy and hurting the software industry.
 
Secondly, using torrents to download files can expose your computer to viruses, malware, spyware, and other malicious programs. These programs can damage your system, steal your personal information, or hijack your online activities. You may also encounter fake or corrupted files that do not work properly or contain unwanted content. You may also face legal consequences if you are caught downloading or sharing illegal files.
 
Therefore, we strongly advise you not to use torrents to download *Foundations of Programming: Object-Oriented Design* or any other course. Instead, you should purchase the course legally from a reputable source such as [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Foundations-Programming-Object-Oriented-Design/96949-2.html) or [Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/object-oriented-design-principles). These platforms offer high-quality video courses on various topics related to programming, web development, design, and more. You can also access other useful features such as transcripts, quizzes, exercises, certificates, and support. By paying for the course, you are supporting the creators and the platforms that provide valuable educational resources for learners like you.
